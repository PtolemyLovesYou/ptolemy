# Ptolemy

## Open Source Universal ML Observability
Ptolemy is an open-source ML monitoring platform that provides comprehensive observability without requiring you to reinvent the wheel for each new methodology. Built with love by engineers who value systems design, performance, and flexibility.

## Why Ptolemy?

### Systems-First Design
We enforce clean architectural patterns, inspired by traditional systems engineering methodologies, that break down your ML systems into logical components. Every system, subsystem, component, and subcomponent has well-defined inputs, outputs, feedback loops, and metadata—making troubleshooting and optimization intuitive.

### Direct SQL Access
Query your data directly with SQL—no black boxes, no limitations. While other platforms lock you into rigid semantic layers, Ptolemy lets you run the complex analyses you actually need, using a language you already know.

### Lightning-Fast Performance
Built with Rust and gRPC for speed-critical components, Ptolemy ingests and processes your data with minimal overhead. We've optimized every part of the stack because milliseconds matter when you're debugging production.

### Nexus, Not a Replacement
We don't want to replace your existing monitoring tools — they're great at what they do. Instead, Ptolemy serves as a central nexus, connecting your observability data sources through our flexible connector ecosystem and extracting insights that would otherwise remain hidden.

### Security Without Sacrifice
While we're building toward full compliance certifications, Ptolemy already includes comprehensive auditing capabilities, fine-grained access controls, and customizable permission schemes. Your sensitive ML data deserves nothing less.

### Deploy Without Drama
We've built Ptolemy on battle-tested technologies you likely already have deployed. No exotic dependencies, no complex infra prerequisites – just standard components that your ops team already knows how to maintain. Deploy in minutes, not months, without fighting the endless approval battles plaguing ML tooling adoption. Because great observability shouldn't require a six-month procurement cycle.

### Built for Extensibility
We understand that ML engineers are (rightfully) opinionated about their observability needs. Every ML system is unique, which is why Ptolemy prioritizes extensibility at our cour. Our plugin architecture lets you integrate with your existing pipelines and tools without forcing you to adopt our opinionis. Whether you're using custom metrics, proprietary data formats, or specialize visualition tools, Ptolemy's flexible APIs and connector framework adapt tio your workflow – not the other way around.
