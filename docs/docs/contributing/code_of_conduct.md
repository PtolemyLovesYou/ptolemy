# Code of Conduct

Ptolemy is a queer-led open team creating tools to make building robust, safe AI easier for everyone. As an ML tooling project, we have a responsibility to actively combat bias and promote inclusion in AI development. We recognize that understanding the diversity of human experience is critical to our development as a scientific field – our goal is to build not just monitoring tools, but a community where everyone can contribute their unique perspectives to make AI better and more equitable.

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers are committed to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* 🌟 Using welcoming and inclusive language
* 🎭 Respecting differing viewpoints and experiences
* 🤔 Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* 💡 Focusing on what is best for the community
* 💪 Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* ❌ The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* ❌ Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* ❌ Public or private harassment
* ❌ Publishing others' private information, such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission
* ❌ Misgendering or deadnaming
* ❌ Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
* ❌ Dismissing or attacking inclusion-oriented requests

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.
