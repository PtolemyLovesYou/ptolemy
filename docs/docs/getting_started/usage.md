    Ptolemy partitions observability data into workspace. To create a workspace, you will need to create an admin user in the UI, then create a workspace.

    To write data to workspaces, you can create a Service API Key in the workspace settings. To learn more about Ptolemy's access management system, read our guide on [Identity & Access Management :lock:](../concepts/iam.md)
